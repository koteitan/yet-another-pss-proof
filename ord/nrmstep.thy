text \<open>
  \<^bold>\<open>Campaign file\<close> for the direct proof of \<open>nrm_step_dec\<close> (and ultimately
  \<open>nrm_order_pres\<close>), via the \<^emph>\<open>one-position increase\<close> relations.

  Empirical theorem (2263 snoc pairs, exact): for standard \<open>C @ [m]\<close>,
  \<open>nrm (translate (C @ [m]))\<close> is obtained from \<open>nrm (translate C)\<close> by exactly
  one of
    \<^item> inserting one leaf \<open>P w Z Z\<close> at a \<open>Z\<close>-position (tail end or empty arg), or
    \<^item> incrementing the subscript of one leaf (the fire-flip
      \<open>D\<^bsub>y'\<^esub>(0) \<rightarrow> D\<^bsub>y\<^esub>(0)\<close>, \<open>y' < y\<close>).
  Both strictly increase \<open><o\<close> by single-position congruence.  The campaign:
  prove the closure of these relations under \<open>proj\<close>/\<open>ins\<close>/\<open>nrm\<close> along the
  recursion, yielding the \<open>Pred\<close> case of \<open>nrm_step_dec\<close>; then the copy (bad)
  case on the same machinery.

text \<open>(T1) the snoc characterization: appending one column to a standard form
  changes the normalized image by exactly one \<open>Rinc\<close> step.  (T2) hence the
  \<open>Pred\<close> case of the step decrease.  The closure lemmas of \<open>Rinc\<close> under
