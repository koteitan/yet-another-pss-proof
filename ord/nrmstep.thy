text \<open>
  \<^bold>\<open>Campaign file\<close> for the direct proof of \<open>nrm_step_dec\<close> (and ultimately
  \<open>nrm_order_pres\<close>), via the \<^emph>\<open>one-position increase\<close> relations.

  Empirical theorem (2263 snoc pairs, exact): for standard \<open>C @ [m]\<close>,
  \<open>nrm (translate (C @ [m]))\<close> is obtained from \<open>nrm (translate C)\<close> by exactly
  one of
    \<^item> inserting one leaf \<open>P w Z Z\<close> at a \<open>Z\<close>-position (tail end or empty arg), or
    \<^item> incrementing the subscript of one leaf (the fire-flip
      \<open>D\<^bsub>y'\<^esub>(0) \<rightarrow> D\<^bsub>y\<^esub>(0)\<close>, \<open>y' < y\<close>).
  Both strictly increase \<open><o\<close> by single-position congruence.  The campaign:
  prove the closure of these relations under \<open>proj\<close>/\<open>ins\<close>/\<open>nrm\<close> along the
  recursion, yielding the \<open>Pred\<close> case of \<open>nrm_step_dec\<close>; then the copy (bad)
  case on the same machinery.

text \<open>(T1) the snoc characterization: appending one column to a standard form
  changes the normalized image by exactly one \<open>Rinc\<close> step.  (T2) hence the
  \<open>Pred\<close> case of the step decrease.  The closure lemmas of \<open>Rinc\<close> under
  \<open>proj\<close>/\<open>ins\<close> along the \<open>translate\<close> recursion are the planned route to (T1).\<close>

lemma nrm_snoc_Rinc:
  assumes "C @ [p] \<in> ST_PS" and "C \<noteq> []"
  shows "Rinc (nrm (translate C)) (nrm (translate (C @ [p])))"
  sorry

theorem nrm_snoc:
  assumes "C @ [p] \<in> ST_PS" and "C \<noteq> []"
  shows "olt (nrm (translate C)) (nrm (translate (C @ [p])))"
  using Rinc_olt[OF nrm_snoc_Rinc[OF assms]] .

text \<open>\<open>Pred\<close> case of the step decrease, from \<open>nrm_snoc\<close>: in the \<open>Pred\<close> branch
  \<open>M[n] = Pred M = butlast M\<close>, so with \<open>M = butlast M @ [last M]\<close> standard the
  decrease is exactly \<open>nrm_snoc\<close> read right-to-left.\<close>

lemma nrm_step_dec_pred:
  assumes M: "M \<in> ST_PS" and L: "1 < Lng M"
    and br: "(entry M 0 (Lng M - 1) = 0 \<and> entry M 1 (Lng M - 1) = 0)
             \<or> \<not> hasParent M (idx1 M (Lng M - 1)) (Lng M - 1)"
  shows "olt (nrm (translate (M[n]))) (nrm (translate M))"
proof -
  from L have j1: "Lng M - 1 \<noteq> 0" by simp
  have MP: "M[n] = Pred M"
    using br
  proof
    assume "entry M 0 (Lng M - 1) = 0 \<and> entry M 1 (Lng M - 1) = 0"
